1. Redo and clean up models code for Reports [Jennifer]
2. Copy the Reports code for Messages to make the create, detail view, and delete work for Messages [Rohan]
  -> (Messages redirects to my_reports for now; make sure to keep the formatting of URL's the same 
  i.e. follow the naming convention I used with _ not -)
3. Make different User types (site managers, investor user, company user) each with their own permissions [Gina]
  -> see issues like A2, C5, B4, B5; will need to change models code and create account code 
4. Create basic groups for users to be put into [Elliott]
  -> should be changing model code to create a Group object, and users can select which groups they are a part of
  -> add to the basic groups code in Sprint 4
5. Messages are sent from one user to another i.e. show up in My Messages (Sprint 2-4) [Jennifer]
6. Create a privacy status button for Messages that users can toggle to make messages private or public [Rohan]


Risks identified: if code written in earlier sprints is not extendable or is not structured correctly, 
it is hard to build upon that in later sprints and it might take much more effort to redo the foundation code 
to add on additional features in later sprints.
