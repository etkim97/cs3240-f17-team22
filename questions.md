## Questions

* Is the system supposed to support crowdfunding? 
* Will all requirements be due each lab? 
* What is the purpose of the Stand alone program? Will we be putting it on our Github? 
* Will the TA's be giving us progress updates on where we should be in our work as well as guidelines on difficulty of work each sprint?
* Will the system involve reviews and/or other user generated content?
